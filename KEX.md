| **Concept**                     | **Description**                                                                                       | **Technical Details**                                                                                                  | **Examples/Protocols**                                   |

| **Key Exchange**                | Securely sharing an encryption key over an insecure network.                                          | Two methods: <br>- **Out-of-Band:** Key shared through a secure medium (e.g., phone, physical delivery). <br>- **In-Band:** Key shared over the same network but protected by encryption. | RSA, Diffie-Hellman (DH), ECC-based exchange.            |
| **Out-of-Band Key Exchange**    | Key shared using an external secure channel (not the network).                                        | Secure but inconvenient.                                                                                              | Examples: Hand-delivering a USB or calling someone.      |
| **In-Band Key Exchange**        | Key shared over the network using encryption to protect it.                                           | Uses **asymmetric encryption** (public/private keys) to secure the key during transmission.                           | TLS (Transport Layer Security).                          |
| **Real-Time Encryption/Decryption** | Encrypting/decrypting data quickly and securely during communication.                               | Symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) is used after key exchange for fast, bulk encryption of session data.                 | HTTPS, VPNs, secure file transfers.                      |
| **Session Key**                 | A temporary symmetric key used for one communication session.                                         | Generated dynamically and exchanged securely using asymmetric encryption. <br>- Ephemeral keys enhance security.       | Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). |
| **Symmetric Encryption**        | Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.                                                 | Efficient and fast. Requires the same key to be securely shared before communication.                                 | AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).                      |
| **Asymmetric Encryption**       | Uses a pair of keys: public (shared) and private (secret).                                            | Public key encrypts data; only the private key can decrypt it. Computationally slower than symmetric encryption.       | RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).                  |
| **Symmetric Key from Asymmetric Keys** | Deriving a symmetric key from public/private key pairs.                                              | - Public and private keys are used to securely agree on a symmetric key.<br>- Math (e.g., modular arithmetic) ensures security. | Diffie-Hellman (DH), RSA key wrapping.                   |
| **Diffie-Hellman (DH)**         | A key exchange protocol allowing two parties to establish a shared secret over a public channel.      | Each party generates private/public keys. A shared secret is derived without transmitting it directly.                 | Standard DH or ECDH (Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman).      |
