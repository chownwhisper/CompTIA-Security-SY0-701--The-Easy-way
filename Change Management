1. Change Management

    What is it?
    It’s about making updates like improving software, updating an app, fixing a firewall, or changing how devices connect to the network.
    Why is it important?
        It’s very common in businesses.
        If not done well, it can lead to problems or even be ignored.
    What helps?
        Clear rules and policies, like how often changes are done and how to undo changes if needed.

2. Change Approval Process

    What is it?
    A formal way to approve changes so things don’t get chaotic.
    Steps include:
        Writing down what needs to change and why.
        Looking at how it might affect other parts of the system.
        Deciding when to make the change.
        Getting approval from those in charge.

3. Ownership

    Who handles the change?
        One person or team is responsible for making the change.
        They don’t have to do all the work themselves but must make sure it gets done properly.
    Example:
    If shipping labels need an update, the shipping department should oversee it since they use it the most.

4. Stakeholders

    Who is affected?
        Everyone impacted by the change has a say.
        It’s not always obvious—one small change might affect multiple teams.
    Example:
    Updating a shipping label system might impact shipping, accounting, and product delivery teams.

5. Impact Analysis

    Why do this?
    To figure out risks and decide if the change is worth it.
    Consider:
        How serious is the risk (small, medium, big)?
        What happens if you don’t make the change? (e.g., security issues, downtime).

6. Backup Plan

    What if things go wrong?
        Always have a plan to reverse the change or fix things.
        Keep backups to avoid losing important data.

7. Maintenance Window

    When should you make the change?
        Pick a time that affects the least number of people (e.g., overnight, not during work hours).
        Consider busy times like holidays or peak seasons.

8. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

    What is this?
        A detailed guide for making changes.
        Everyone follows the same steps to avoid confusion.

9. Test Results

    Why test?
        To make sure the change works before it’s applied in the real system.
    Steps include:
        Test in a safe environment (sandbox).
        Confirm backups are ready.
        Apply the change in production only after testing.
