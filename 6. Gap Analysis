1. Gap Analysis (Finding the difference)

    What it means: Look at where you are now and where you want to be.
    How it works: Find the "gap" between your current situation and your goal.
    Why it’s important: To know what needs to change, you might need to do research and collect information.
    Timeframe: This could take a long time, like weeks or months, since it requires talking to people, gathering data, and doing technical research.

2. Choosing the Framework (Setting clear rules and goals)

    What it means: Pick a guide or set of rules to follow (a "framework").
    Steps:
        Work towards a clear goal, like better security.
        Use widely recognized standards, such as:
            NIST 800-171: A set of rules to protect sensitive data.
            ISO/IEC 27001: A global standard for managing information security.
    Why it matters: A good framework keeps you on track and ensures you're meeting important standards.

3. Evaluate People and Processes (Understanding what’s happening now)

    What it means: Look at how things are currently done and who’s doing them.
    Steps:
        Check how skilled employees are and what they know.
        Review the training they’ve had and how experienced they are.
        Examine current processes and systems, like IT and security policies.
    Why it matters: You need to understand the current situation before making changes.

4. Compare and Contrast (Spot the problems and plan improvements)

    What it means: Compare the current system to your chosen framework or goal.
    Steps:
        Identify weaknesses or problems in the current setup.
        Break big security issues into smaller, manageable pieces.
        Write a detailed report on what you found.
    Why it matters: This helps you clearly see what needs fixing.

5. The Final Analysis and Report (Create a plan to move forward)

    What it means: Bring everything together into a final comparison and plan.
    Steps:
        Show what needs to change and how to get there.
        Include details like what tools, time, or policies are needed to close the gap.
    Why it matters: This is your roadmap for improving the system, step by step.

In simple terms, this process is like figuring out what’s wrong with a car (gap analysis), deciding what tools you’ll use to fix it (framework), checking the parts and mechanics (evaluate), finding the exact problems (compare), and then writing a repair plan (final report).
