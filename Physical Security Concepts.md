| **Barricades / Bollards**   | Prevent unauthorized access, control entry to specific points.                                | - Blocks vehicles but allows pedestrian access. <br> - Includes barriers, bollards, or extreme measures (e.g., moats). | Protect buildings, public spaces, and high-traffic areas from vehicles or unauthorized access.     |
| **Access Control Vestibules** | Manage controlled entry through a dual-door system.                                          | - Doors usually locked/unlocked in sequence. <br> - Only one door opens at a time to control access.        | High-security areas like banks, data centers, and restricted facilities.                          |
| **Fencing**                 | Build a secure perimeter to prevent unauthorized access.                                      | - Can be **transparent** (chain-link) or **opaque** (wood/solid). <br> - Options for added deterrents like razor wire. | Securing boundaries of properties, sensitive sites, or open spaces.                              |
| **Guards and Access Badges**| Provide human oversight and identification for entry control.                                 | - Security guards monitor key points. <br> - Badges include photo/ID and must be worn. <br> - Two-person control for high-security areas. | Facilities, offices, and restricted zones requiring personal validation and monitoring.            |
| **Video Surveillance (CCTV)** | Monitor and record activities for real-time or post-event review.                             | - Includes motion detection, facial recognition, and object tracking. <br> - Networked cameras for large areas. | Used in offices, public places, critical infrastructures, and high-security zones.                |
| **Sensors**                 | Detect unauthorized activity or environmental changes.                                        | - **Infrared:** Detects heat/movement. <br> - **Pressure:** Detects force changes. <br> - **Microwave:** Detects movement over wide areas. <br> - **Ultrasonic:** Uses sound waves for motion detection. | Integrated into alarm systems for homes, offices, and high-security buildings.                    |
| **Lighting**                | Enhance visibility and deter attackers.                                                      | - Avoid shadows/glare for better visibility. <br> - Lighting angles and brightness improve camera performance. | Outdoor spaces, parking lots, pathways, and areas requiring 24/7 surveillance.                    |
