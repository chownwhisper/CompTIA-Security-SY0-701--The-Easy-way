Honeypots

    Definition: A honeypot is a decoy system or resource set up to attract attackers and study their behavior without harming real systems.

    Key Points:
        Attract and trap attackers: Honeypots are designed to lure malicious actors by simulating vulnerabilities or valuable data.
        Fake "attacker" interaction: Often, the attackers interacting with a honeypot are automated systems (bots) rather than humans, which generates useful data for analysis.
        Variety of implementations: Honeypots can mimic various systems or applications to observe different attack methods.
        Battle between real and fake: The system needs to appear real enough to fool attackers but isolated to prevent real harm.
        Open-source tools available: Many tools exist for creating honeypots, such as Project Honeypot.

Honeynets

    Definition: A honeynet is a network of interconnected honeypots designed to create a more extensive deception network.

    Key Points:
        Larger deception networks: Honeynets involve multiple devices, such as servers, routers, or switches, to simulate a real network.
        Multi-source data: They gather a broader range of information from various nodes in the network.
        Practical uses: They help study attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) while protecting real systems.

Honeypot Examples

    Traceable Data:
        Adding unique markers (e.g., tags, fake credentials) to the honeypot to track data breaches. If stolen data resurfaces, its origin can be traced.
    Fake API Credentials:
        These credentials are generated to simulate access but only trigger notifications when used.
    Fake Email Addresses:
        These are added to honeypots and monitored for misuse to detect spamming or phishing activities.
    Other Examples:
        Includes database records, cookies, and web page pixels designed to observe malicious activity.
