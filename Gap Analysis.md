| **1. Gap Analysis**        | Assess the current state of systems, processes, and security against the desired target state.                  | - Perform baseline assessments.<br>- Identify gaps in compliance, security, and functionality.<br>- Collect technical data. | To define areas of non-conformance and establish improvement priorities.                    |
| **2. Choosing the Framework** | Select a security or compliance framework that aligns with organizational goals and regulatory requirements. | - Define scope and objectives.<br>- Adopt standards like **NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2** (CUI protection) or **ISO/IEC 27001**.<br>- Set measurable targets. | To ensure the improvement process adheres to standardized best practices.                   |
| **3. Evaluate People and Processes** | Evaluate organizational resources, technical systems, and operational workflows to identify current capabilities. | - Assess skill levels and training of personnel.<br>- Review IT infrastructure and architecture.<br>- Analyze existing security controls and policies. | To understand current operational effectiveness and identify technical or process deficiencies. |
| **4. Compare and Contrast** | Perform a structured gap analysis by benchmarking against the selected framework.                            | - Map existing controls to framework requirements.<br>- Identify weaknesses in technical controls (e.g., firewalls, access management).<br>- Document findings in a detailed technical report. | To identify control gaps and prioritize mitigations.                                        |
| **5. Final Analysis and Report** | Develop a roadmap to achieve compliance or target state with detailed action plans and milestones.        | - Define corrective actions (e.g., control implementation, policy updates).<br>- Establish timelines and resource needs.<br>- Deliver a formal report with key findings and recommendations. | To guide remediation efforts with clear, actionable steps for continuous improvement.       |
