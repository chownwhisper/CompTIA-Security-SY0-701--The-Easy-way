| **AAA Framework**       | A security framework used to manage user and device access through Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. | - Identification: Verifies the claimed identity (e.g., username).<br> - Authentication: Validates identity using credentials (e.g., password, biometrics).<br> - Authorization: Determines access permissions based on policy.<br> - Accounting: Logs user actions (e.g., login/logout times, data transfers). |
| **Authenticating People** | The process of validating the identity of a person using credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, or biometrics). | - Requires a client to provide credentials.<br> - Verified via an AAA Server using protocols like RADIUS or TACACS+.<br> - If credentials are correct, access is granted. |
| **Authenticating Systems** | The process of verifying the identity of a device, often through digital certificates issued by a trusted CA. | - Use X.509 certificates for authentication.<br> - Ensures devices are trusted to access sensitive systems.<br> - Common for VPNs, IoT devices, and automated systems. |
| **Certificate Authentication** | A method of identity validation where a Certificate Authority (CA) issues digitally signed certificates to ensure authenticity. | - Certificates are tied to a public key infrastructure (PKI).<br> - The CA's digital signature validates the certificate.<br> - Used in SSL/TLS and device authentication. |
| **Authorization Models** | A framework for defining and enforcing access control policies for authenticated entities (users or devices). | - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign permissions based on predefined roles.<br> - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Use attributes (e.g., department, location) to define policies.<br> - Simplifies access management by abstracting user-to-resource relationships. |
| **No Authorization Model** | A basic access structure where users directly interact with resources, with no intermediary control or abstraction. | - Example: User directly assigned permissions to access specific files or services.<br> - Challenges: Difficult to manage at scale, lacks flexibility, and is prone to errors. |
| **Using an Authorization Model** | A structured access control system that abstracts user-resource interactions by implementing scalable access policies. | - Reduces complexity with central policy enforcement.<br> - Supports roles, groups, and attributes.<br> - Scalable for large environments with many users or resources. |
