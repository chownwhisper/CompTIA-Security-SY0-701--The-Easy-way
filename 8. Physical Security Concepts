1. Barricades / Bollards

    Purpose: Prevent unauthorized access by vehicles or people.
    Use Cases:
        Direct access through a single controlled point.
        Restrict access to pedestrians, vehicles, or both.
    Types:
        Safety barriers to protect people and property.
        Bollards (short vertical posts) can block vehicles while allowing pedestrian movement.
        Extreme examples: concrete barriers or even moats.
    Application: These are effective in areas where physical barriers are necessary to protect buildings or public spaces.

2. Access Control Vestibules

    Functionality:
        Doors are typically locked or only one can be opened at a time.
        Ensures that individuals are funneled through a controlled process, restricting unauthorized entry.
    Mechanisms:
        Dual doors where unlocking one prevents the other from opening.
        Often used in high-security areas or banks.
    Advantage: Ensures only authorized individuals or controlled groups are allowed entry at a time.

3. Fencing

    Purpose: Build a perimeter to prevent unauthorized entry.
    Types:
        Transparent: Allows visibility, like chain-link fences.
        Opaque: Provides privacy, such as wooden or solid fences.
    Features:
        Robust design for security.
        Additions like razor wire to prevent climbing.
        Important to make the fence high enough for effectiveness.
    Goal: To deter and prevent intrusion or unauthorized access.

4. Guards and Access Badges

    Security Guards: Provide physical security at key points like entrances and reception areas.
    Access Badges:
        Badges verify identity and grant access to certain areas.
        Often include pictures and other identifying details.
        Mandatory for staff to wear at all times.
    Two-Person Integrity/Control:
        Ensures no single person can access critical areas alone, reducing risk of insider threats.
    Purpose: Combines human oversight with technology for stronger security.

5. Video Surveillance

    CCTV (Closed Circuit Television):
        Acts as a digital "watchdog."
        Can replace physical guards in certain scenarios.
    Advanced Features:
        Motion detection, facial recognition, license plate identification.
        Object detection alarms when something unusual is seen.
    Integration: Many cameras are networked together and record continuously.
    Purpose: To monitor and record activity for real-time or post-incident review.

6. Sensors

    Types and Functions:
        Infrared: Detects heat signatures (works in light and dark).
        Pressure Sensors: Respond to changes in force (e.g., stepping on a surface).
        Microwave: Detects movement across larger areas.
        Ultrasonic: Uses sound waves to detect motion or collisions.
    Use Cases: These sensors are often part of alarm systems or automated security setups.

7. Lighting

    Why Itâ€™s Important:
        More light deters attackers since they prefer darkness.
        Helps security cameras work better, especially non-IR (Infrared) cameras.
    Design Considerations:
        Avoid shadows and glare to ensure consistent visibility.
        Proper angle and placement enhance facial recognition.
    Goal: Use specialized lighting to improve safety and security at night or in dim areas.
