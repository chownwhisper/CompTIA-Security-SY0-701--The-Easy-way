| **Change Management**      | - A structured approach to implementing IT or operational changes (e.g., upgrading software, network configurations). <br> - Common but often poorly managed due to lack of planning or oversight. <br> - Requires policies such as rollback procedures, scheduling, and duration limits.                              | - Changing firewall rules to block/allow specific ports.<br> - Upgrading database servers to a newer version. |
| **Change Approval Process**| - Formalized process to ensure changes are reviewed and approved before deployment.<br> - Steps include: <br> 1. Submit a Change Request (CR).<br> 2. Define scope, purpose, and risk analysis.<br> 3. Assess systems impacted and schedule downtime.<br> 4. Secure approval from the Change Advisory Board (CAB).                          | - Submitting a CR for deploying a patch to address a security vulnerability, reviewed by the CAB.             |
| **Ownership**              | - The "change owner" is accountable for the end-to-end implementation. <br> - Responsibilities include monitoring progress, ensuring adherence to policies, and validation post-deployment. <br> - Ownership often lies with the department most affected by the change.                                             | - An application team owning the deployment of a new release in their managed application.                     |
| **Stakeholders**           | - Stakeholders include all individuals or teams affected by the change.<br> - May involve cross-functional teams if the change spans multiple systems or services.<br> - Stakeholders must review impacts such as system dependencies, business processes, or customer-facing services.                             | - A CRM software upgrade might involve IT (infrastructure changes), Marketing (data integration), and Sales (user interface updates). |
| **Impact Analysis**        | - A detailed risk assessment of the change. <br> - Risks are categorized as low, medium, or high severity. <br> - Consider downstream impacts (e.g., integration points, service disruptions).<br> - Evaluate the consequences of **not implementing** the change.                                     | - Failing to upgrade an OS may result in unpatched vulnerabilities, increasing exposure to cyberattacks.       |
| **Backup Plan**            | - Prepare mechanisms to restore systems to their pre-change state if a deployment fails.<br> - Maintain backups of critical systems (e.g., databases, configurations).<br> - Implement a rollback strategy or contingency plan for recovery.                                            | - Snapshotting VMs before updating system dependencies.<br> - Backing up SQL databases before schema changes. |
| **Maintenance Window**     | - Specific, pre-determined time for implementing changes to minimize user impact.<br> - Scheduled during off-peak hours or downtime (e.g., weekends, evenings).<br> - Consider business cycles, especially for 24/7 environments or seasonal spikes.                                        | - Applying ERP updates overnight to avoid disrupting production environments during business hours.            |
| **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** | - A detailed document outlining the steps for implementing, testing, and validating changes.<br> - Includes compliance with organizational standards, rollback methods, and escalation points.<br> - SOPs ensure consistency and auditability.                                         | - A documented process for upgrading Kubernetes clusters, including step-by-step CLI commands and rollback options. |
| **Test Results**           | - Changes are first tested in isolated "sandbox" or non-production environments to mimic real-world conditions.<br> - Testing involves functional validation, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.<br> - Confirm backups and rollback procedures before production deployment.                             | - Validating application functionality in a staging environment post-patch before deploying to production.      |
