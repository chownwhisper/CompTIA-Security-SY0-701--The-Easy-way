1. CIA Triad Overview

The CIA Triad is a model that outlines the three core principles of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Together, they help ensure data is protected from unauthorized access, tampering, and disruptions. Sometimes, this model is referred to as the AIC Triad.
2. Confidentiality

    Goal: Keep information accessible only to those who are authorized to see it.
    Methods:
        Encryption: Encoding data so only authorized users can read it.
        Access Controls: Restricting access to data and resources based on user roles.
        Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an extra step to verify a user's identity before granting access.

3. Integrity

    Goal: Ensure data remains accurate and unaltered unless modified by authorized means.
    Methods:
        Hashing: Converting data into a fixed-length value to detect unauthorized changes.
        Digital Signatures: Verifying data origin and confirming it hasn't been altered.
        Certificates: Using digital certificates to verify identity.
        Non-repudiation: Providing proof of data integrity to prevent denial of actions.

4. Availability

    Goal: Keep systems and data accessible to authorized users when needed.
    Methods:
        Redundancy: Duplicating critical components to avoid downtime.
        Backups: Regularly saving copies of data for quick recovery if needed.
        Disaster Recovery: Having a plan to restore systems after an incident.
        Access Control Mechanisms: Balancing security to ensure ease of access for legitimate users.

Summary

The CIA Triad represents the foundational principles of data security:

    Confidentiality: Protects against unauthorized access.
    Integrity: Guards against unauthorized modifications.
    Availability: Ensures systems are operational and accessible to legitimate users.
