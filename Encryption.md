| **Step**                  | **Description**                                                                 | **Key Actions**                                                                                           | **Purpose**                                                                                           |

| **Encrypting Stored Data** | Protects data stored on devices or in the cloud from unauthorized access.       | - Use Full-Disk Encryption (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault).<br> - Implement File-Level Encryption for specific files. | Prevent data breaches if a device is stolen or accessed without authorization.                       |
| **Transport Encryption**   | Secures data while it travels across networks, protecting it from interception. | - Use TLS/SSL for web traffic (e.g., HTTPS).<br> - Set up VPNs to secure all transmitted network data.<br> - Use IPSec for site-to-site VPNs. | Prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks during data transmission.                        |
| **Selective Data Encryption** | Encrypts only critical sections of a dataset, such as specific database columns. | - Identify sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit cards).<br> - Apply column-level or field-level encryption.    | Reduce processing overhead while maintaining security for sensitive data.                            |
| **Encryption Algorithms**  | Uses cryptographic formulas to transform plaintext into ciphertext securely.    | - Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., AES for strong symmetric encryption).<br> - Ensure algorithm is implemented securely. | Safeguard data by preventing unauthorized decoding of encrypted information.                         |
| **Key Stretching**         | Enhances weak cryptographic keys by increasing computational effort to crack them. | - Use PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2.<br> - Apply hashing repeatedly with a salt for key strengthening.            | Make brute-force attacks computationally expensive and impractical.                                  |
| **Cryptographic Keys**     | Generates, stores, and manages keys used for encryption and decryption.         | - Use strong keys (e.g., 256-bit AES, 2048-bit RSA).<br> - Secure keys in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or Key Management System (KMS). | Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the encryption process by protecting key secrecy.         |
